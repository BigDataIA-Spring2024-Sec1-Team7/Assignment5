Title: Financial Analysis Techniques: Overview, Learning Outcomes, and Summary

Introduction:
Financial analysis tools are essential in evaluating a company's performance and future trends. Analysts convert data into financial metrics to assist in decision making and answer questions regarding a company's past and future performance, value, and securities. While financial reports provide data on a company's past performance and current financial condition, they do not necessarily provide all the information needed for analysis or forecast future results. Analysts must supplement financial statements with other information, including economic data, industry analysis, comparable companies, and company-specific information. This reading focuses on financial analysis techniques used to analyze a company's financial statements, specifically under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and United States generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP).

Learning Outcomes:
1. Describe tools and techniques used in financial analysis and their uses and limitations.
2. Classify, calculate, and interpret activity, liquidity, solvency, profitability, and valuation ratios.
3. Describe relationships among ratios and evaluate a company using ratio analysis.
4. Demonstrate the application of DuPont analysis of return on equity and calculate and interpret effects of changes in its components.
5. Calculate and interpret ratios used in equity analysis and credit analysis.
6. Explain the requirements for segment reporting and calculate and interpret segment ratios.
7. Describe how ratio analysis and other techniques can be used to model and forecast earnings.

Summary:
Financial analysis techniques summarize financial reporting data and evaluate a company's performance and financial position. These techniques provide important inputs into security valuation. The key facets of financial analysis include the use of common-size financial statements and financial ratios to remove the effect of size and enable comparisons. Activity ratios measure operational efficiency, liquidity ratios assess short-term obligations, solvency ratios evaluate long-term obligations, profitability ratios determine profit generation, and valuation ratios express the relation between market value and fundamental financial metrics. Ratios can be analyzed individually or as a group to understand their interdependencies and the impact of efficiency and leverage on profitability. The results of financial analysis also aid in forecasting future earnings and cash flow.
